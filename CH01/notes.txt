Creating an Executable File
	1. The programmer uses an editor to write the code for the program, which
	usually has the extension .cpp.
	2. Then the compiler is invoked, which reads the source code and translates
	it into an object file, which usually has the extension .obj
	3. Finally a linker runs and links the object file to any external files as
	necessary and creates an executable file, usually ending in .exe.


Dealing with Errors
	1. Compile errors: Occur during code compilation. cause an object file not
	to be produced. they can be syntax errors, which are caused by typos. the 
	compiler can also issue warnings, which don't have to be listened to, but it
	is recomended that you fix them and then recompile and run again.
	2. Link errors: occur ding the linking process. may indicate that the
	program references something externally that cannot be found.
	3. Run-time errors: Occur when the executable is run. they can cause a crash
	but are often just logic errors that don't cause the program to crash.


Understanding the ISO Standard
	The ISO standdard for C++ is a definition of C++ that describes exactly how
	the language should work. It also defines a set of files called the Standard
	Library that contians building blocks for every programming task.
